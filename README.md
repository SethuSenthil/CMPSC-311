# CMPSC-311

## This repository contains my work for CMPSC-311 (Systems Programming) at Penn State. In this course, I extensively used the C programming language to explore various concepts related to memory management and low-level programming.

Throughout the course, I gained a deep understanding of how to efficiently manage memory in C, including dynamic memory allocation and deallocation using functions like `malloc()` and `free()`. I also learned about pointers, arrays, and structures, which are fundamental to low-level programming.

By working on assignments and projects, I honed my skills in writing efficient and optimized code, as well as debugging and troubleshooting at a low level. This experience has greatly enhanced my understanding of computer systems and has prepared me for tackling complex software development challenges.

Feel free to explore the contents of this repository to see the projects and assignments I completed during CMPSC-311.
